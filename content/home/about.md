# About me

I am a postdoctoral researcher in the Singapore-ETH Center at ETH Zurich (Project Principal Investigator: [Teck-Hua Ho](http://teckho.com)). My research considers how firms should incorporate consumer behavioral biases into pricing and choice architecture design. I conduct both empirical research to tackle the descriptive problems of how certain behaviour occurs, and theoretical research to tackle the prescriptive problems of how firms should respond. In my current work, I use field experiments to develop evidence-based policy and strategy recommendations.
