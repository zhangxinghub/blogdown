To form accurate beliefs about the world (e.g., whether the earth is flat or a sphere, whether vaccination causes autism, etc), people must encounter diverse views and opinions which will sometimes contradict their
pre-existing views. Many scholars concerned that the emergence of social media reduces the cost of acquiring information from a wide range of sources, facilitating consumers to self-segregate and limit themselves to the information sources that are likely to confirm their views. 

The issue is how bad is this problem? Not so bad on Facebook according to some recent empirical research. Here I will show my findings using Twitter data.

```{r results, eval = FALSE}
x = 1
# library(rtweet)
# library(tidyverse)
# library(UpSetR)
# 
# TwitterAccount <- c("NASA", "FlatEarthOrg", "FlatEarthToday")
# # Fetch the data from Twitter using get_followers() function
# followers <- map_df(TwitterAccount,
#                     ~ get_followers(.x, n = 3000000, retryonratelimit = TRUE) %>%
#                       mutate(account = .x))
# followers <- read_csv("NASA.csv")
# Uniq_followers <- unique(followers$user_id)
# 
# # for each follower, get a binary indicator of whether they follow each tweeter or not and bind to one dataframe
# FollowDummies <- TwitterAccount %>%
#   map_dfc(~ ifelse(Uniq_followers %in% filter(followers, account == .x)$user_id, 1, 0) %>%
#             as.data.frame) # UpSetR doesn't like tibbles
# # set column names
# names(FollowDummies) <- TwitterAccount
# 
# # plot the sets with UpSetR
# upset(FollowDummies,
#       nsets = 5,
#       main.bar.color = "maroon",
#       sets.bar.color = "DarkCyan",
#       sets.x.label = "Follower Count",
#       text.scale = c(rep(1.4, 5), 1),
#       order.by = "freq")
```
