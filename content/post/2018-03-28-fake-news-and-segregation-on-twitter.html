<hr />
<p>To form accurate beliefs about the world (e.g., whether the earth is flat or a sphere, whether vaccination causes autism, etc), people must encounter diverse views and opinions which will sometimes contradict their pre-existing views. Many scholars concerned that the emergence of social media reduces the cost of acquiring information from a wide range of sources, facilitating consumers to self-segregate and limit themselves to the information sources that are likely to confirm their views.</p>
<p>The issue is how bad is this problem? Not so bad on Facebook according to some recent empirical research. Here I will show my findings using Twitter data.</p>
