People commit the sunk cost fallacy when their decisions are influenced by costs that have already been incurred and cannot be reversed. The implication of the sunk cost fallacy to price discount is that people tend to consume less of the product when they purchase the product at discounted price. Recently, the gambling- or lottery-type price discount is drawing more and more attention from both practitioners and researchers. It is unclear how this probabilistic price discount affects consumption, and how it differs from the sure price discount with the same cost. In a large-scale randomized field experiment conducted in a museum, we compare the impact of these two price discount schemes on the length of time customers stayed in the museum. We found that the length of stay is more likely to be reduced by the probabilistic price discount than the sure price discount. In another treatment condition, we offered the consumer a choice between these two price discount schemes. We found offering choice increases the length of stay compared to the probabilistic price discount and sure price discount without choice. The results are consistent with diminishing sensitivity to sunk cost and reference-dependent sunk cost effect.
