Consumers commit the sunk cost fallacy, a canonical example of irrationality, when their decisions are influenced by costs that have already been incurred and cannot be reversed. Results from field studies on the existence of the sunk cost effect are mixed. In this paper, the authors report a large-scale randomized field experiment involving more than 2,800 museum customers. The authors randomly assigned the participating customers to different rebate schemes and studied the influence of sunk costs on the length of time customers stayed in the museum. On average, customers who received a full rebate for the cost of the admission ticket reduced their length of stay in the museum by 9%. The sunk cost effect was mainly observed in the behavior of customers who came alone or with family members, rather than friends. For these customers, making a choice between two rebate schemes with identical expected rebate amounts increased the length of stay. The observation is consistent with the predictions of a mental accounting model with a reference-dependent sunk cost effect.
