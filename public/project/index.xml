Consumers commit the sunk cost fallacy, a canonical example of irrationality, when their decisions are influenced by costs that have already been incurred and cannot be reversed. Results from field studies on the existence of the sunk cost effect are mixed. In this paper, the authors report a large-scale randomized field experiment involving more than 2,800 museum customers. The authors randomly assigned the participating customers to different rebate schemes and studied the influence of sunk costs on the length of time customers stayed in the museum.</description>

When confronted with difficult choices, individuals often choose to avoid decisions by failing to act, sticking to the status quo, or procrastinating. Here we examine the usage of coin flipping to help resolve choice difficulty in the setting of donation. In a randomized field experiment, we find that coin flipping increases donation when choice is hard due to choosing between two equally attractive charities, but not when choice is relatively easy with matching fund provided to one of the two charities.</description>

We study how consumers respond to a common fraudulent practice in the market &amp;ndash; scam emails over time. In a field experiment with more than 14,000 email users, we found that repeated experience with one type of scam is mainly helpful for the consumer to deal with the same type of scam, but may backfire when the consumers face a new type of scam. More specifically, one group of users received 3 scam emails in 2 months ostensibly asking users to install a security update, and another group of users &amp;ndash; control group, did not receive such emails during this period.</description>

This paper examines the role of the sunk cost fallacy as a self-commitment device and its implication for optimal price contract design. Consumers evince the sunk cost fallacy if they condition the consumption level on the sunk cost incurred in the past. Our empirical study suggests that consumers are able to anticipate the fallacy associated with the health club membership fee \textit{ex ante}, and hence they may rationally exploit this fallacy to counteract their future self-control problem in health club attendance.</description>
