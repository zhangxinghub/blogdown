Consumers commit the sunk cost fallacy, a canonical example of irrationality, when their decisions are influenced by costs that have already been incurred and cannot be reversed. Results from field studies on the existence of the sunk cost effect are mixed. In this paper, the authors report a large-scale randomized field experiment involving more than 2,800 museum customers. The authors randomly assigned the participating customers to different rebate schemes and studied the influence of sunk costs on the length of time customers stayed in the museum.</description>
