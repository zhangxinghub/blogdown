      <description>This note describes how sample size calculator works. There are must be better notes somewhere else, but I find the best notes for me is the note written by myself.
How Sample Size is Determined?Suppose there are two groups, Treatment (T) and Control (C) group. The research is to test whether there is difference in the proportion of the response between two groups. The null hypothesis is there is no difference in response (\(H_0\): \(p_T=p_C\)), and the alternative hypothesis is \(H_A\): \(p_T\neq p_C\).</description>
