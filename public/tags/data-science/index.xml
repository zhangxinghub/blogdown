      <description>To form accurate beliefs about the world (e.g., whether the earth is flat or a sphere, whether vaccination causes autism, etc), people must encounter diverse views and opinions which will sometimes contradict their pre-existing views. Many scholars concerned that the emergence of internet especially recent social media reduces the cost of acquiring information from a wide range of sources, facilitating consumers to self-segregate and limit themselves to the information sources that are likely to confirm their views.</description>

      <description>When requesting individual level data from others (a company or a government agency), we usually need to properly anomymize the individuals to protect their privacy. The following is an example:
(Data = data.frame(Name = c(&amp;quot;John Smith&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Jenny Ford&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;Vivian Lee&amp;quot;), Secret = c(&amp;quot;Hate dog&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;Afraid of ghost&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;A bathroom dancer&amp;quot;)))## Name Secret## 1 John Smith Hate dog## 2 Jenny Ford Afraid of ghost## 3 Vivian Lee A bathroom dancerOne simple way is we can just drop the Name, and only keep the Secret since we are more interested in their secrets.</description>

      <description>I just finished the book Everybody Lies: Big Data, New Data, and What the Internet Can Tell Us About Who We Really Are by Seth Stephens-Davidowitz, which is a highly rated book. The author devoted a great amount of text to the Google Trends data. My fun part of reading this book is that I could dig the results from the Google Trends website myself.
Here is one example: in the book the author argues that Google search reveals that contemporary American parents are far more focused on their sonâ€™s intelligence than on their daughters.</description>
