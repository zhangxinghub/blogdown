      <description>One function I miss about Stata is its tabstat. By using just one line code, it can produce very useful summary statistics such as mean, and standard error by groups by conditions. R has its own built-in summary function â€“ summary(), too, but in most cases in my research, I found the summaries produced is barely useful. Consider the following pseudo-data:
library(data.table)set.seed(10)N = 120DT = data.table(x = rnorm(N,1), y = rnorm(N,2),category = sample(letters[1:3], N, replace = T))DT[1:10]## x y category## 1: 1.</description>

      <description>How Sample Size is Determined?Is it the end of the world if \(\alpha = 0.005\)?In this paper by Benjamin et al (2017) on redefining statistical significance, they proposed to change the default P-value threshold for statistical significance from 0.05 to 0.005 for claims of new discoveries. That is the proposed p-value is one tenth of the conventional one!! Suppose the world changed to p=0.005. Do we need 10X more sample?</description>

      <description>When requesting individual level data from others (a company or a government agency), we usually need to properly anomymize the individuals to protect their privacy. The following is an example:
(Data = data.frame(Name = c(&amp;quot;John Smith&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Jenny Ford&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;Vivian Lee&amp;quot;), Secret = c(&amp;quot;Hate dog&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;Afraid of ghost&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;A bathroom dancer&amp;quot;)))## Name Secret## 1 John Smith Hate dog## 2 Jenny Ford Afraid of ghost## 3 Vivian Lee A bathroom dancerOne simple way is we can just drop the Name, and only keep the Secret since we are more interested in their secrets.</description>
