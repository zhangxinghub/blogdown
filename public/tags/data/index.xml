      <description>One function I miss about Stata is its tabstat. By using just one line code, it can produce very useful summary statistics such as mean, and standard error by groups by conditions. R has its own built-in summary function â€“ summary(), too, but in most cases in my research, I found the summaries produced is barely useful. Consider the following pseudo-data:
library(data.table)set.seed(10)N = 120DT = data.table(x = rnorm(N,1), y = rnorm(N,2),category = sample(letters[1:3], N, replace = T))DT[1:10]## x y category## 1: 1.</description>

      <description>MotivationTwo-lines ApproachesRegression with Clustered Standard Errors and Many Fixed EffectsThis post shows how to use Two-lines method to test U-shape relationship, and how to estimate the model with clustered standard errors and many fixed effects.
MotivationIn this paper by Uri Simonsohn (2017), the author proposed a noval method to test U-Shape relationship. In the literature, the popular way of testing U-shapeness relationship between x and y is to add a quadratic term in the regression \(y=\beta_0+\beta_1 x + \beta_2 x^2 +\epsilon\) (\(\epsilon\) is an i.</description>
