This paper examines the role of the sunk cost fallacy as a self-commitment device and its implication for optimal price contract design. Consumers evince the sunk cost fallacy if they condition the consumption level on the sunk cost incurred in the past. Our empirical study suggests that consumers are able to anticipate the fallacy associated with the health club membership fee \textit{ex ante}, and hence they may rationally exploit this fallacy to counteract their future self-control problem in health club attendance.</description>
