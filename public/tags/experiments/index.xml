      <description>How Sample Size is Determined?Is it the end of the world if \(\alpha = 0.005\)?In this paper by Benjamin et al (2017) on redefining statistical significance, they proposed to change the default P-value threshold for statistical significance from 0.05 to 0.005 for claims of new discoveries. That is the proposed p-value is one tenth of the conventional one!! Suppose the world changed to p=0.005. Do we need 10X more sample?</description>
